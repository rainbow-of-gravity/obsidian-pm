# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added the "Open project notes in" setting: opening a project note the regular way (file explorer, quick switcher, a wikilink) can now swap it into the project viewer automatically, the way task notes already can via "Open tasks in" -> Tab
- Added an "Open as note" action to the project view and project overview, to drop back to Obsidian's own markdown editor

## [2.4.1] - 2026-09-15

### Changed

- Done subtasks in the task editor no longer add an underline to their link on hover
- Moved the command line to its own repository, [dotpm/cli](https://github.com/dotpm/cli)

## [2.4.0] - 2026-09-15

### Highlights

- **Local API:** Other apps and scripts on your computer can now read and edit your projects, and every change shows in Obsidian as it happens. Off by default.
- **MCP server:** Connect a coding agent and it works your board. It picks up a task, updates it, closes it, or turns a rough plan into a project full of tasks while you do something else. Every write goes through the same checks the views use, so it cannot break your notes.
- **Command line:** Your projects are one `dotpm` command away from any terminal or script. Search tasks, change a status, follow edits as they happen.
- **Agent skill:** A ready-made skill that teaches an agent how dotpm works, so it gets things right on the first try. Drop it in and go.

### Added

- Added exporting a view as a standalone HTML page with the table, timeline, and board
- Added a local HTTP and MCP server that lets other apps on the same computer read and edit tasks and create projects, off by default
- Added the `dotpm` command line tool for listing, searching, and editing tasks and creating projects, installed from npm as `@dotpm/cli`
- Added the `dotpm` agent skill for coding agents that use the MCP tools or the command line
- Added a release notes tab that opens after an update, and the "Show release notes" command
- Added the "Show release notes after updates" setting

### Changed

- Tasks and projects referenced in a note's properties are now written as links, including in older notes
- A project's description now lives in the note body instead of its properties

### Fixed

- Fixed a project description edited in the note being reverted by the next save
- Fixed an open timeline ignoring the granularity setting until it was reopened
- Fixed subtasks appearing twice when the parent listed them more than once ([#306](https://github.com/dotpm/obsidian-pm/issues/306))
- Fixed collapsed tasks in the table and timeline expanding when a task note changed outside the plugin ([#305](https://github.com/dotpm/obsidian-pm/issues/305))
- Fixed tasks failing to save when the note name differed from the title only in capitalization ([#308](https://github.com/dotpm/obsidian-pm/issues/308))
- Fixed creating a project failing when a note with the same name in different capitalization existed
- Fixed the task title not being focused when the task dialog opens ([#303](https://github.com/dotpm/obsidian-pm/issues/303))
- Fixed the project name not being focused when the new project dialog opens
- Fixed the project name and icon above a view not responding to the keyboard

- Fixed properties added by other plugins being removed on save when a note's properties could not be read

## [2.3.1] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Fixed status, priority, date, and tag pickers opening outside the dialog with themes that blur or transform dialogs ([#276](https://github.com/dotpm/obsidian-pm/issues/276))

## [2.3.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Added a setting to use Shift+Enter or Ctrl/Cmd+Enter as the save shortcut

### Changed

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Added a year zoom level to the timeline, with quarters under each year ([#50](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/50), [#77](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/77), [#147](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/147))
- Added duplicating a project with all its tasks, from the project list menu or the "Duplicate project" command
- Added a funding link to the plugin's entry in Obsidian's plugin list

### Changed

- Renamed the plugin to dotpm, after the [dotpm](https://dotpm.pm) organization the repository moved to ([#269](https://github.com/dotpm/obsidian-pm/issues/269)). Commands now appear under **dotpm** in the command palette. Hotkeys, settings, task files, and updates are not affected.
- Subtasks, parents, and dependencies are now written as links, so they show up in the graph view

### Fixed

- Fixed edits, dependency checks, and archiving acting on the wrong project when a project was created by copying another's folder
- Fixed the expand/collapse arrow being hard to click in the table, project list, and Gantt views ([#266](https://github.com/dotpm/obsidian-pm/pull/266))
- Fixed the due date field in the table keeping only the first digit typed

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-27

### Highlights

- **Auto-archive:** Completed tasks move to the project's archive after a set number of days. Set it once for all projects or per project, or run the "Archive completed tasks" command to archive them now.
- **Inherited custom fields:** Define custom fields once for the vault or on a parent project, and every project below gets them. A project can still rename, retype, or hide an inherited field, or merge its own field into it.

### Added

- Added automatic archiving of completed tasks after a set number of days ([#204](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/204))
- Added a per-project auto-archive setting
- Added the "Archive completed tasks" command
- Sub-projects now inherit the custom fields of their parent project ([#255](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/255))
- Added vault-wide custom fields that every project starts with
- Inherited custom fields can now be renamed, retyped, or hidden in project settings
- A custom field that duplicates an inherited one can now be merged into it, values included

### Fixed

- Fixed renaming a project from its settings page leaving the note and folder with the old name
- Fixed views failing to load when a note's team members, assignees, tags, or dependencies held an invalid value ([#252](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/252))
- Fixed a leftover connector line next to items nested two levels deep under the last sibling

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-25

### Highlights

- **Breaking change:** Requires Obsidian 1.13 or later. Update Obsidian before installing this release.
- **Project overviews:** Opening a project shows its own page with progress, description, a milestone timeline, sub-projects, and properties. A new setting opens the task list directly instead. It's up to you.
- **Sub-projects and multi-project views:** Projects can nest under a parent, and the table, board, and timeline can show a project's subtree, its folder, or the whole vault, each with its own saved views and filters.
- **A folder per project:** Each project keeps its note and tasks in one folder. Existing projects migrate automatically.
- **Cross-project dependencies:** Tasks can depend on or block tasks in other projects, and scheduling follows those dates.
- **Custom priorities and per-project config:** Add, rename, recolor, and reorder priorities. A project can set its own statuses, priorities, default view, and scheduling.
- **Progress and completion timing:** Set task progress from 0 to 100, and see whether a completed task finished on time or how many days late.
- **People notes:** Link assignees and members to person notes, with avatars, automatic notes for new names, and commands that list one person's tasks.
- **Better wikilinks:** Names, custom fields, and project links written as wikilinks resolve to their notes everywhere. We all love those nice obsidian graphs!
- **Improved custom fields style:** Custom fields use the same controls as built-in properties: dates open the date picker, selects share the status popover, and the table shows links, avatars, and real checkboxes.
- **A searchable icon picker:** Pick status, priority, and project icons from every icon Obsidian has, or use any emoji.
- **Settings rework:** Settings are grouped by area, with statuses, priorities, team members, and TaskNotes on their own pages, and show up in Obsidian's settings search.
- **Tasks in tabs:** Open tasks in a tab instead of a modal.
- **TaskNotes import:** Import tasks, statuses, and priorities from TaskNotes, including dates, dependencies, subtasks, tags, and archive state.
- **A lighter index behind the scenes:** The project list, pickers, and due date reminders read from a lightweight index instead of parsing every project file, so large vaults stay fast.
- **Updated sync engine:** A task or project open in several tabs stays in sync, and an edit in one shows up in the others right away.

### Added
